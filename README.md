# 90 Days Calculator for Social Workers

This app counts 90 days of health insurance for unemployed people.

## History

As a social worker I had to count 90 days from a day customer applied for health insurance. To do so I had to use table callendar and count these 90 days day by day in loud environment with coworkers chatting around :) As you can imagine it was very easy to make mistakes.
Counting 90 days took approx. 10 minutes if you were lucky and didn't have to recheck it again :)  
One day I decided to learn **JavaScript** and make a calculator which will count these 90 days for me.  
So I did.  
This is super-easy app but even my managers heaven't seen something similar. We decided to share this app with other social institutions and it did work! I reveived a lot of positive feedback from institutions around whole Poland.  

## How to use it?

All you need to do is pick the starting date from browser's callendar and hit the "Oblicz" button (which means Count it).
Third navy/blue area from the top will display the proper date - the ninetieth day of insurance.  
Hope you will enjoy it.
